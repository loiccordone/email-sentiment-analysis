Steve, Its your responsibility to come and collect the order from me not mine. I HOPE YOU ARE NOT TELLING ME HOW TO DO MY JOB, I HAVE DONE ORDERS FOR 7 YEARS. Pat Burley, Customer Relations Supervisor
Hi Sunil, This will be my last email. If I don't hear back from you, I'll assume that you have no interest in our service, and I can spare your inbox a few needless messages :)
Attention All Employees, There is a brown paper bag lunch in the break room refrigerator without a name. It's behind the ranch dressing and it smells like bologna. If this odorous brown bag happens to be yours, PLEASE DISPOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY. Thank you, -Management
DEAR MADAM OR SIR, PLZ TAKE THE TIME OUT TO READ THIS EMAIL. I KNOW U WIL LUV IT! IT HAS SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS NOT GOOD EMAIL ETTIQUETTE. :) LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE THESE MISTAKES. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT PASS IT ALONG TO 30 OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN READ THE TIPS BELOW ON WHAT IS GOOD EMAIL ETIQUETTE. THANK U.
Yesterday I asked people how they would make an extra $100 in one month. Here's an even more interesting question for you: Let's say I kidnapped your dog, and won't give him back unless you come up with $1,000$. <strong>How would you make an extra $1,000 in that 30 days?</strong> It could be working extra hours at your job, it could be a side business you run. It can be whatever you want. The more details the better. Let me know your answers! Neville
Dear Avaaz movement, I have a crazy confession to make. I started Avaaz, and I don't sign many petitions. I always think, "yeah, but what difference is my one extra signature going to make?" I feel like I have more important things to do, like making sure our petitions are powerfully delivered.  But wow, am I glad the rest of us don't think this way. Because while it's true that the 1,137,540th signature doesn't by itself change the game, the whole million of them absolutely can. And the whole million is just a million individual people hoping, believing and acting. Doing *their* part, however small, to make a better world. <b>Without people who make that individual choice, our movement would not exist. </b> I've always been awed by the decency of the people in this movement. You teach me again and again. And in reflecting on this question of why we sign, I come back to my own behaviour. And I pledge to sign more. <b>To be part of that simple act of connection to others, in hope, service, and that precious kind of strength that we can only find together. </b> With gratitude for this stunningly beautiful movement, Ricken and the team

Dear friends, From the chaos, something beautiful is emerging -- <strong>people's movements are destroying the darkest dreams of the far-right</strong> and carving out a new and exciting path forward for all of us. Our amazing movement has been in the middle of this global battle and winning! <p style="color:blue"><strong>We are turning the tide on Brexit</strong></p> <strong>Britain's election decimated conservative Theresa May and her Brexit plans</strong>, even opening up a return to a unified Europe -- thanks in part to a massive tactical voting and youth turnout campaign that won in 90% of the districts we took on! <p style="color:blue"><strong>We halted the far-right in France</strong></p> Outsider Macron blew open France, <strong>sweeping to the presidency on a platform of tolerance and hope</strong>, winning an historic majority in Parliament and keeping the far-right Le Pen at a measly 8 seats (out of 577!) Our viral election video had millions of views, and our major get out the vote effort against Le Pen reached more people than most major parties! <p style="color:blue"><strong>We have Monsanto on the back foot in Europe</strong></p> Over a million people added their name to an official call to ban Monsanto best-selling poison glyphosate, triggering a debate and response from Europe's Parliament and potentially derailing a plan to allow this chemical to cover our food -- and our movement supercharged the campaign's record breaking growth! Let's keep fighting and writing this new story of hope, together. With respect and admiration, Bert, Luis, Emma, Luca, Fatima, Julie, Mike and the whole team at Avaaz
Where are those reports??? They were due an hour ago!!!! PLEASE SEND THEM
It is unaceptable that the report was late. I now have to stay in the office to talk to the client tonigh and explain why they didnt get this report when they asked. Make sure that this never happens agains. Rachel
Mark, Here is a spreadsheet detailing our September Socal trades. (I did not distinguish between buys vs. sells.) Phillip
Greg, Got your message. Good luck on the bike ride. What were you doing to your apartment?  Are you setting up a studio? The kids are back in school.  Otherwise just work is going on here. Keith
Jacques, Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue. I think that was the last issue to resolve. Phillip
Phillip and Keith, this cold of mine is getting the better of me. Would it be possible to reschedule our meeting for tomorrow?  If so, please reply to this e-mail with a time.  I am open all day, but just need to get some rest this afternoon. George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC
Dear exchange-students, you have returned to your home university end of August or September 2016 from your time as an exchange student here at TUM. We hope you enjoyed your time in Munich – academically and beyond. At this point, we would like to learn more about your experiences here. We highly value your feedback. Your contribution will help us to improve our services for future generations of exchange students. Thank you for your cooperation and a Happy New Year 2017 !!! Sincerely, Petra Ritter
Dear Madam or Sir, Please take the time out to read this mail. I know you will love it! It has several examples of what is not good email ettiquette. :)  Lot of people make theses mistakes. When you're finished with it pass it along to 30 other people and then read the tips below on what is good email etiquette. Thank you !
Dear exchange student, As you most likely know, last Friday a gunman killed nine people and injured many others in Munich before committing suicide. We are deeply saddened by the events and Munich is grieving for the tragic loss of life. As your family and home institution may be concerned about your well-being, we would like to ask you to get in touch with them as soon as you can (unless you’ve already done so) to confirm your safety. In case you have been affected by the events or you know about a fellow student being affected, please let us know so that we can help as best as we can. Warm regards, Petra Ritter

Professor Palmer, I think the grade you gave me is outrageous. I have never earned a grade so low in my life. I did the reading, wrote the paper, and turned it on time. That has to count for something! I'd like to ask you to reconsider my grade on this paper. I do not believe it is deserving of an F. Thanks, Pat

I appreciate your concern for my bald head. My wife likes it and I don't get paid enough to get hair implants. On a side note... What were you drinking last night? Next time you email me id like a bottle of whatever you had so I don't have to remember what you said. Bye, Mr Martin

<b>Hi team,</b> <span style="color:purple">We'll be meeting this Friday to review the changes to our quarterly metrics.</span> The meeting will go a lot smoother if everyone comes with three items they'd like to see addressed in Q4. <span style="color: red">I BELIEVE IN THIS TEAM!</span> And don't forget to bring your <span syle="color: aqua">smiles.</span> :) :) <b>See you 9 AM sharp!!</b> Kimmy

am i being ignored? Jerk
Fangming, Looks good.  That's exactly what we're looking for.  John, please comment if there are any additional features you'd like to add. Brian
Jim: I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning. It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a longer term view. I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen again.  John
Ann, Once he gets this back to you, please run it by Mark Taylor.  If he is okay with it, email the final version back to me, because the crew in Toyko needs it ASAP.  Thanks!  Margaret
Thank you so much for your time last week. David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market. This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond.Best regards Andy Thank you.
Please provide an explanation for the memos.  If you have any questions, please call me at 5-4541. Thank you, Johnny Thibodeaux
John, Can you send an email to Stephanie Sever to approve my access to the ICE system. Dutch
Hi Piotr, Your bragging won't do any good. I'm not interested in what you're offering.
I don't care about your stupid book, can you please stop spamming my inbox with your religious non-sense ? Thanks in advance.
What the fuck Mike ? You told me you wouldn't cash my cheque before the end of the month !
Hello, I'm really disappointed by your behaviour during our meeting. I can no longer continue to work with you, so I decided to change banks. I'll forward all the info needed. I hope this is our last exchange. Ms. Johnson
Hey Mom, The trip was fun but I lost $650.  It wasn't good for the wallet.  Vegas is a fun weekend trip but I can't imagine staying longer than that. How was your weekend? -eric
Hey, Sorry to hear about mike's Dad.  I hope he is handling it ok. I'm guessing your weekend wasn't very fun. We had a great time at the black swan, maybe you can come next time!  Let me  know when you want to come by.(if ever, ha!) later
Is anybody up for going to Two Rows tonight?  I promise I won't get AS drunk tonight. We'll be there around 8:00.  Be there or be SQUARE!. Eric
that's BULLSHIT! I'm not coming tomorrow night!
hey sheila, thanks for the invite. my mom's b-day is this friday as well.  i still don't know if we are taking her out on friday or saturday.  so we will try to make it.  -eric
Hi Eric, I am totally out of cash and have not been able to go get checks cashed.  Could you please bring $400 tomorrow and I'll give you a check?  Thanks.
Congratulations on the wedding!  A sister, finally!  I'm sure your family is really excited!  As for Enron, you are right, things will happen for the best. They always do for you, Ner. Cat
Hi Sally, I want to thank you for interviewing with me last Thursday.  You made the interview more relaxing and I enjoyed our conversation.  After speaking with you and the other Enron people, I've become very interested in Enron.  I would be thrilled to come work with you at Enron. Sincerely, Max Sell
Dear Sally, I'd like to take vacation from December 15 - 26 to goto Canada.  Please let me know if this doesn't fit for some reason. Best regards, Shona
Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her title? She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.  
Peggy, As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to discuss. Thanks, Joe
Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit. Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the tasks I sent you yesterday. Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.  
Sally -- just FYI in case it comes up, a counterparty search was done on the potential Terrorist list related to the Asset Freeze that Bush ordered. We found one name in the system that matched, and we are currently working on determining if we have actualy transacted with the person. Will keep you posted if we find out that we have or are doing business with him. Beth
Please find attached the final doorstep reports for the last few reviews that occurred.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of these reports further.  Thanks, Christy
Thanks for the note and your words of encouragement.  It is exciting to work on something that helps build a strong franchise for Enron. I appreciate the opportunity of being a part of that. --Sally  
Always nice to see positive things. Thought I'd share this with you. --Sally 
Yes I did thank you. How to I make the file we discussed yesterday (so that the macro can be applied to any excel file with no need to copy/paste into every excel file)? Best regard Lindsay
This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up? SInce your name was not on the original list, I am forwarding this to you. Ben
Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.  --Sally 
This is great. I want to use it at our upcoming credit conference. Thanks, Rick
I will be unable to attend this meeting as I will be in Canada meeting with banks. Bill Bradford could attend in my absense if Dan thinks appropriate. Rick
I really appreciate it when people take the time to acknowledge Mark's efforts and others in RAC as well. Thanks for the feedback. Rick
Totally supportive  of candidate. I hope we can get her. Only issue was reluctance to move to Houston or London. That will hurt us eventually. Rick
Please do not extend offers of employment to anyone without checking with me first. This does not mean a freeze but rather I want to be sure there isn't a person in RAC that may be better suited, or could be with a little training, for a particular position. Thanks, Rick
MORE than <span style="font-weight: bold">horrible</span> !!!! Booking by internet, at the arrival of the reception, you remove your keys from a PLC. The hotel is shabby looking more like a sordid passing hotel. The room is dirty (hair and hair on the sheets and on the pillows, mold in the shower and taps, spider webs on the ceiling ... etc), the walls are dirty, the mattress has to be done (It is curved and patient to form more of the hammock than a mattress), the shower curtain is dirty, the shower is quite cramped ... Remote control dirty TV, dated TV; Advertisements for Canal channels but no reception of these channels. Other negative, reception closed almost permanently (open 8am - 10am and 5pm - 8pm). The staff, crossed for breakfast, is nevertheless friendly and helpful. In short our advice, in spite of its good position with respect to the airport, go ahead without luggage.
Hi Dude, <b>F</b>or your information, <b>U</b>nderstand you’ve got no skills about mail analysis, and you’ll <b>C</b>ontinue to be the « Poulidor » of the builders day as long as you’ll refuse to <b>K</b>eep out the computer science … <b>Y</b>ou’re now a salesman ! But <b>O</b>bviously, you’ll persit in your <b>U</b>nbelievable mistake …
Dear colleague, You definetively understand nothing. First, i am not used to such aggressiveness. I prefer collaboration and friendship. The bad atmostphere is harmful to the quality of work. Second point, i love you. And i am really disapointed about you request. For those reasons, and many others, I conclude that i can’t do no other than express my disapproval. So, stop with your <span style="color:rgb(0,200,26)">dumb</span> messages. Thanks a lot to take it into account. Sylvie
Dear Sir, <b>WHAT</b> ? I won't thank you for the work. It is just amazing that you dare ask me to do such a thing. I hope this is only because you are in a bad mood. Sincerely yours, Vincent
Do not stay in this absolute dump of a hotel, and I use the term hotel very loosely. I cannot convey strongly enough how disgusting this place is.blood stained headboards that have clearly been up since the world war (the first one), rude staff, windows that won't close, no hot water, broken furniture, dirty utensils, broken light fixings and actual poo in the kettle. Pretty sure I'm going to end up with some sort of rash/ disease due to sanitation conditions similar to those of a homeless crack head. In summary...this place is a complete hole.
stay out of it its haunted i saw the ghost in my room over my 4 yr boy i screamed and ran out my room we collected our thing and checked out in the middle of the night the rude man in the front desk wanted to charge us for a day while we only stayed 6 hrs after checking out my sister told me she heared water flushing in the toilet and my nanny saw the tv channels switching by it self while my kids watching tom and jerry but they didnt think that it really haunted our room# was 303
Front desk guy really rude to me. He couldn't care if I existed. I was invisible to him and beneath his attention when I had to walk to the front desk to complain about no hot water, no toilet paper. I had to walk to the front desk because every time I phoned the line was busy! He was chatting on it! Don't waste your money here.
I was most disappointed by the cat paws in my room, but this was partly made up by the toilet which doubled as a floor power wash when flushed. The stained/burned duvet and Chester no drawers were as promised. To be fair to the place we survived.
We cannot believe that they could advertise this as a hotel suitable for families. <b>It is not</b>. We walked in and straight away we didnt feel safe, the bedroom doors did not shut properly the locks were dodgy and the place was filthy. We had two teenagers with us one being female and she cried. The only good thing about this" hotel" was the woman who gave us our money back 10 minutes after we got there, we legged it and went to the travel lodge. Do not take young children or teenagers to this hotel. <span style="color: purple">I am not happy</span> with the rating that I have given as if it was up to me I would not have rated it at all.
This is by far the worst place ive stayed in. i found a cats paw in my pillow case. Also ahd chest of drawers with no drawers in them, a cupboard with no back a double bed the size of a hammock made of concrete. Communal toilets with no locks. Our neighbour lived in it had tv on all day and nite didnt close door. It should be named Alcatraz. Also, pay in cash only haha, thats a sign of dodgy things. Enjoy ur stay
My girlfriend were having a romantic meal, however it was spoilt when an employee spat in my hair. CHEEKY OR WHAT?
I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. <b>Hated it.</b> Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.
Myra Breckinridge is about as funny as a child molester. It is <b>an insult to intelligence</b>, <b>an affront to sensibility</b> and <b>an abomination to the eye</b>.
It’s rare to see a piece of shit that actually looks and sounds like a piece of shit. It’s kind of exciting! The stars are unprotected, vulnerable in a way you don’t see them anymore, looking like porn actors who’ve wandered onto the set without a clear idea of where their marks are..
It is impossible to read this book and come away with the impression that you have read anything other than the completely unedited ramblings of an idiot.
The novel is a 576-page monument to insignificance. The author uses facile tricks to tart up the story as a total account of American life.
Shelley, We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back. Sorry for the delay. Suzanne
Ginger, It was <b>so</b> nice to talk with you.  Please find attached a copy of Shelley Corman and Kim Erb's homestudy. Thanks, Suzanne Hoffman
Joceyln, I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office. Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check. Thanks
Just got off the phone with Jennie and I know you already talked to her. My direct flight tomorrow cleared so I plan on taking it.  I will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th & then we can spend some of our waiting time together.
Hi Becky, I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work. I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address. She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer. Shelley
Hi Sherene, Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball. I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.  Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.   A box is on its way to you. Have a blessed holiday. LOVE Shelley
I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next <b>Thursday, Dec. 13.</b>  I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday. Shelley
Jennie, I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements.  I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning. I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed. Jan 9.  My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ? Please advise Shelley Corman
Barbara, Received your message.  I can't promise that I will attend, as things are pretty much ad hoc at my household at this time while I try to establish some new routines.  I'll try. See you Sunday.
Would it make sense for us to chat?  If you do not have any concerns about your partner program, then I want to respect your time and there would be no need to chat.  If, however, you have areas you are trying to address, I’d like to learn what those challenges are.  Would you be so kind to let me know if you feel quick chat would be valuable to you? Have a great weekend!
I love you too.  Thanks for the surprise.  Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.  He especially loved the special kiss.
I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.  She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.  I inadvertently dropped her name from the list. Thank you for everything you do.  I'm always <b>overwhelmed</b> by your kindness. Shelley
I am looking for a way to assist a co-worker that is under stress with a wife with health problems, a baby and two other children at home.  I am interested in getting details about how I might pre-pay for a two-week personal chef service. Could you give me a quote on two-week service to this family located in the Copperfield area? Would you deliver the pre-made meals to the home?  Could the gift recipient select the menu items? Shelley Corman
This was our first time in Mallorca. So glad we chose this hotel. When we arrived we received a very warm welcome from the staff on reception and the glass of cava was very welcome. We had a lovely room on the 3rd floor but had a problem with the air conditioning. The way the staff handled this is the sign well trained, great staff... Nothing was too much trouble. You are never made to feel an inconvenience.. All the staff (cleaners, waiters, pool staff, bar staff, reception, managers et al) put the customer first and you are always made to feel welcome. The pool areas are always clean and they change your towels whenever you wish. Plenty of sun loungers and parasols and staff on hand at all times.
Four of us have just returned from two weeks in this lovely hotel. It is a small hotel with a boutique feel in an excellent location yards from the main street with good facilities, a nice pool, really friendly, helpful staff and great service; we would go back tomorrow! We stayed in deluxe mountain view rooms which were a good size with nice views and the housekeeping team kept them really well. The restaurant was great with an extensive breakfast buffet and great all day snack menu and very reasonably priced evening menus. Staff are lovely and really helpful. We would thoroughly recommend it!
We really enjoyed our two week stay at the Aimia. Well appointed room and kept spotlessly clean by housekeeping. Breakfast was everything you would expect from a 4* hotel. Perfect location for the beach, restaurants and bars. Staff friendly and helpful at all times. We have already booked again for next June as we loved Soller and this hotel offers everything you need for a relaxing stress free holiday.
Breathtaking, and that's from someone who lives in a mountainous area in Ireland. Scenery changes throughout the day. Views are spectacular.
Very interesting building right on the sea front. Easily found and close to all main attractions in Palma. Lovely plaza with restauraunts outside. Restaurants had reasonable lunch prices and seemed very popular. Unfortunately the place was closed although we had just fome from the tourist information centre who recommended the visit.
